# L-system
L-system fractals in OpenSCAD, JavaScript and XQuery

The basic L-system symbols:  F (forward) ,+ (turn left), - (turn right) are implemented in all versions with many examples provided, with thanks, by Paul Bourke https://paulbourke.net/fractals/lsys/ .
The JavaScript version expands this to included bracketing and stocastic grammars and includes examples from 'The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants' 

The XQuery version is online here   https://kitwallace.co.uk/fractals/fractal.xq?

The enhanced Javascript version, part of a suite for generating GCode for a ceramic FDM printer, is here https://kitwallace.co.uk/FO/Fractal.html
